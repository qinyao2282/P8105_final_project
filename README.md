# P8105_final_project

This is our p8105 final project. This project analyzes several potential factors associated with heart disease mortality. 

The index.Rmd is our website that you can visit to see our whole project, both by a narrative screencast and some web pages showing our work.  

Before we start our analysis, we first tidied the data in tidy/Data_Aource.Rmd. We conbined several datasets to generate the final dataset that we used to do the analysis.

We made a shiny dashboard, and the code can also be found in tidy/shiny.Rmd.
