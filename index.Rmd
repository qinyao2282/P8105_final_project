### Summary and Goal of This Project 

This project was aimed to make analysis towards the potential geographical and demographical factors that may contribute to the mortality rate of heart disease. As students in public heath school, the motivation of our project is to learn about heart disease, which keep threatening people's lives. Moreover, as students who are in biostatistics track, we are data-driven and committed to obtain potential prevention actions based on precise data analysis.
