### Summary and Goal of This Project 

Jiabei Wang(jw3726), Haowei Ni(hn2339), Shuo Yan(sy2825), Bihui Sun(bs3134), Qinyao Wu(qw2282)

This project was aimed to make analysis towards the potential geographical and demographical factors that may contribute to the mortality rate of heart disease. As students in public heath school, the motivation of our project is to learn about heart disease, which keep threatening people's lives. Moreover, as students who are in biostatistics track, we are data-driven and committed to obtain potential prevention actions based on precise data analysis.

### Data Source

* Our main dataset [Heart Disease Mortality Data Among US Adults (35+) by State/Territory and County](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/heart-disease-mortality-data-among-us-adults-35-by-state-territory-and-county-5fb7c) is first published by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. This dataset was created on May19, 2017, and recently updated on August20, 2018. We download the CSV file to make further analysis. 
* The potential factors we think may contribute to the mortality rate of heart disease are:
 
* [Tobacco Consumption](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/behavioral-risk-factor-data-tobacco-use-2011-to-present-e0ad1), dataset published by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on October14, 2016

* [Income](https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income/data/tables.html), dataset published by United States Census Bureau on 2017.

* [Obesity](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-obesity-by-state-b181b), dataset published by Lake County, Illinois on Novermber17, 2018.

* [Air Quality](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/air-quality-measures-on-the-national-environmental-health-tracking-network), dataset published by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on December16, 2015

* [Stroke Mortality](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/stroke-mortality-data-among-us-adults-35-by-state-territory-and-county-50ff2), dataset published by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on October8, 2016

* Our research questions include
1.  What was the geographic distribution of mortality rate?
The map of mortality rate we created can be found [here](https://sy2825.shinyapps.io/p8105_final_project)

2.  Does the mortality rate has difference between the state that are in coastal area or inland area?
The difference can be found [here](https://sy2825.shinyapps.io/p8105_final_project)

3.  Can we make a logistic model for heart disease mortality rate based on the variables that have significant correlation? 
The preliminary model we created can be found [here](mlr_analysis.html)

4.Will gender and race will influcence stroke and heart disease mortality rate?
The interaction relationship can be found [here](dashboard_template.html)

### Conclusions and Public Implications
We found that mortality rate of heart disease is negatively related with income and positively related with obsesity problems. The potential prevention can be governmment subsidizing poor on their health insurance. Also, obesity problems should be put under spotlight in out society.
